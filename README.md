Collaborative-Drawing
=====================
Using Magic(tm) and Science(R), I have made something that Google already did years before me. 
Now you can draw with someone else as if you were sharing the same paper, but your hands can't 
collide with each other!

We are not responsible for ruined friendships due to someone hopping on your server and 
scratching your drawing up, then just saying "whoa whoa whoa it's just a prank bro" and then
everything's k because he said that it's just a prank
